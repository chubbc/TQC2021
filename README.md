This is my first test of using manim for both a pre-recorded and life conference presentation. 

This talk was built upon manimCE 0.7.0. The live slides are built on react.js, and visible <a href="http://christopherchubb.com/TQC2021">here</a> (see my <a href="https://github.com/chubbc/manim_slides">manim_slides</a> repo for details on how that works). The source code for the full talk is also included in <code>full_talk</code>.

The Q&A using the live slides is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn3aIxk6ZQk">here</a>, and the full talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zkNOs0dt4Y">here</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk92HkWNTe0">original conference video</a>).
