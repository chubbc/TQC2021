Allows for a <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a> presentation consisting of queued up Manim animations. Based on <a href="https://github.com/anjandn/manim_reveal">anjandn/manim_reveal</a>, but updated to work with ManimCE 0.7.0 (manim_reveal was broken by manim updates).

Go <a href="https://christopherchubb.com/manim_slides">here</a> for a live demonstration of it working.

Manim code is put into <code>./talk.py</code>, and the corresponding slides need to be put into <code>./index.html</code>. To compile the manim videos for slide X run <code>manimce talk.py X</code>.

To view a local copy you must run <code>npm start</code> on the local copy.
